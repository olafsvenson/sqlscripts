  <Description>Direct reports recursion example</Description>
  <Text>-- The following example shows the semantics of the recursive CTE structure by returning a 
-- hierarchical list of employees, starting with the highest ranking employee, in the 
-- Cycles company. The statement that executes the CTE limits the result 
-- set to employees in the Research and Development Group. A walkthrough of the code execution 
-- follows the example.

USE /*database_name*/;
GO

WITH /*CTE_name*/ (/*parent_id_col*/, /*child_id_col*/, Title, DeptID, /*level_col*/)
AS
(
-- Anchor member definition
    SELECT e./*parent_id_col*/, e./*child_id_col*/, e.Title, edh.DepartmentID, 
        0 AS /*level_col*/
    FROM /*schema*/./*recursive_table*/ AS e
    INNER JOIN /*schema*/.EmployeeDepartmentHistory AS edh
        ON e./*child_id_col*/ = edh./*child_id_col*/ AND edh.EndDate IS NULL
    WHERE /*parent_id_col*/ IS NULL
    UNION ALL
-- Recursive member definition
    SELECT e./*parent_id_col*/, e./*child_id_col*/, e.Title, edh.DepartmentID,
        /*level_col*/ + 1
    FROM /*schema*/./*recursive_table*/ AS e
    INNER JOIN /*schema*/.EmployeeDepartmentHistory AS edh
        ON e./*child_id_col*/ = edh./*child_id_col*/ AND edh.EndDate IS NULL
    INNER JOIN DirectReports AS d
        ON e./*parent_id_col*/ = d./*child_id_col*/
)
-- Statement that executes the common table expression
SELECT ManagerID, /*child_id_col*/, Title, /*level_col*/
FROM /*CTE_name*/
INNER JOIN /*schema*/.Department AS dp
    ON /*CTE_name*/.DeptID = dp.DepartmentID
WHERE dp.GroupName = N'Research and Development' OR /*level_col*/ = 0;
