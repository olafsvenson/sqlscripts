/*
dbPath
	The path where your database files are stored. Defaults to /data/db.
journal.enabled
		Whether to enable journaling or not. It’s recom-mended to enable this as it may save data that was lost during a power outage and hasn’t been synchro-nized to disk. Defaults to true on 64-bit systems.
engine
		Which storage engine to use. Defaults to mmapv1. To use WiredTiger, set this to wiredTiger.
wiredTiger
		This is where WiredTiger-specific options are set.
engineConfig.cacheSize
			This is how much RAM memory WiredTiger needs to reserve for the in-memory data, which would then serve as a cache to rapidly serve your data. Defaults to half the physical RAM on your system, at least 1 GB.
engineConfig.journalCompressor			
			Tells WiredTiger what kind of compressor to use for the journaling data. Defaults to snappy, but this is best set to none to achieve the best performance.
collectionConfig.blockCompressor
			This tells WiredTiger what kind of compressor to use for the collection data. The three supported options are none,snappy, and zlib. You’ll see in the benchmarks which is the best option for you. Defaults to snappy.
indexConfig.prefixCompression
			This tells WiredTiger whether to use compression for its index data. Defaults to true.
