/*=============================================
  Variables:
    @MinHistExecutions - Minimum number of job executions we want to consider 
    @MinAvgSecsDuration - Threshold for minimum job duration we care to monitor
    @HistoryStartDate - Start date for historical average
    @HistoryEndDate - End date for historical average
 
  These variables allow for us to control a couple of factors. First
  we can focus on jobs that are running long enough on average for
  us to be concerned with (say, 30 seconds or more). Second, we can
  avoid being alerted by jobs that have run so few times that the
  average and standard deviations are not quite stable yet. This script
  leaves these variables at 1.0, but I would advise you alter them
  upwards after testing.
 
  Returns: One result set containing a list of jobs that
  are currently running and are running longer than two standard deviations 
  away from their historical average. The "Min Threshold" column
  represents the average plus two standard deviations. 

  note [1] - comment this line and note [2] line if you want to report on all history for jobs
  note [2] - comment just this line is you want to report on running and non-running jobs
